## Data Read In
DataAnalysis_ReadIn/DataWrangling.ipynb reads in each output file from our project. It compiles all of our data into one "super matrix" for coefficients and accuracy eacy, for easy data analysis. There are no dependencies. To run the code simply open the notebook and click run all. Each of the required data files is in the repo.

## LogisticLassoRegression
### Requires glmnet
LogisticLassoRegression/Logistic_regression_testing.ipynb performs logistic regression and lasso regression on the t-tested data sets. The required files are already in place, so all that needs to be done is open the notebook and click run all.
